# Science education through narrative in Brazil and Africa: Cultural studies and experimental framework under a common Trading Zone


<!-- 
a narrativa tem sido historicamente usada pra passar informações de maneira altamente eficiente de geração pra geração, muitas vezes até em situações onde não haja escrita. essas narrativas ajudam na tomada de decisões, com aspectos éticos, etc. mas quando se fala de educação em ciência a narrativa é deixada de lado pra focar na aprendizagem "dos fatos". ou seja, nós estamos deixando de lado um dos, senão *o* principal mecanismo de transmissão de conhecimento da humanidade nessa conferencia nos vamos entao usar o conhecimento de narrativa em humanidades pra gerar ideias que possam mais tarde ser testadas experimentalmente.

Despite multiple attempts to have a direct conversation between the Humanities and experimental sciences under the concept of inter or transdisciplinarity, much has been discussed but little has been accomplished. <!-- ref -->The purpose of this project is to organize a "Humanities-Empirical Sciences Trading Zone" during the National Week of Science and Technology (Semana Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia/SNCT) between 13 and 19th of October 2014. 

The purpose of this Trading Zone will be to share concepts and tools between those in the Humanities and experimental sciences by using the following framework:

1. Day 1 - Trading zone purpose and experimental concepts and tools: An educational researcher focused on experiments in Science Education, from Duke University (USA), will discuss the main concepts behind experimental design in education and then lay out a simple framework for experimental design. He will also demonstrate how an existing, online experimental educational platform can be used to test a series of theories from the Humanities in relation to their efficacy in online education.
2. Days 2 and 3 - Narrative concepts from the Humanities and their translation into an experimental design: A group of philosophers, anthropologists, sociologists and historians will present regarding their areas of interest related to African and Brazilian culture in relation to narrative. Following each presentation, a Trading Zone will be formed in an attempt to frame how the theory that was just presented could be potentially tested in an educational experiment.

At the end of this three-day event occurring during the SNCT we will have not only an in-depth discussion about how a number of narrative theories can be used in Science Education, but we will also have described these theories in a format that can then be used in future educational experiments. An article will be written and subsequently published contextualizing and discussing selected concepts presented during this conference.
