## Goals

The central objective of the Narrative & Education Conference is to bring researchers in the Humanities and Data Science into a Trading Zone. Briefly, rather than stopping at the dialogue level as is traditionally the endpoint of most interdisciplinary efforts, we will instead create a discussion that immediately results in experimental designs to be later tested in empirical studies. 

## Need

Narrative has traditionally being the most central mechanism to transmit knowledge among human beings, people gathering around the fire for thousands of years. Despite being a highly effective mechanism for knowledge transfer, resistant even to the lack of a written language, when it comes to Science Education narrative is largely ignored. Our conference will address this issue in a highly innovative way, by organizing a Trading Zone where researchers in the Humanities and Data Sciences, can not only talk but actually creating empirical projects with the aim of improving Science Education.
