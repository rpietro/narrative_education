## Goals
  
The central objective of the Narrative & Education Conference is to bring researchers in the Humanities and Data Science into a [Trading Zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_zones). Briefly, rather than stopping at the dialogue level as is traditionally the endpoint of most interdisciplinary efforts, this Trading Zone will instead create a discussion that immediately results in experimental designs to be later tested in empirical studies. 

The central objective of the Narrative & Education Conference is to bring researchers in the Humanities and Empirical Science into a [Ecologias do Saber](http://www.abenge.org.br/CobengeAnteriores/2012/artigos/103774.pdf). Briefly, rather than stopping at the dialogue level as is traditionally the endpoint of most interdisciplinary efforts, this Ecologia do Saber will instead create a discussion that immediately results in experimental designs to be later tested in empirical studies. This conference will be created in partnership with the Personalized Learning Consortium [http://personalizedlearningconsortium.org/](http://personalizedlearningconsortium.org/), an international group of researchers interested in the use of education technology to promote the personalization of adult education around the globe.

## Need and background theory

Narrative has traditionally been the most central mechanism to transmit knowledge among human beings, people gathering around the fire for thousands of years. Despite being a highly effective mechanism for knowledge transfer, resistant even to the lack of a written language, when it comes to Science Education narrative is largely ignored. Our conference will address this issue in a highly innovative way, by organizing a Ecologias do Saber where researchers in the Humanities and Empirical Sciences, can not only talk but actually creating empirical projects with the aim of improving Science Education.

### Science education in Brazil

High-quality university programs in Brazil, particularly in areas such as applied sciences, technology, and engineering, could dramatically increase the country’s competitiveness, productivity and growth, as well as enable economies to diversify away from today’s continuing reliance on high technology coming from North America, Europe and Asia. Strategic reforms are needed to expand access to science-based education, ensuring  that they complete their undergraduate or graduate studies with cutting-edge knowledge that is relevant and meets the needs of the private sector.

To accelerate the transition process, it is required that the government aggressively invest in science and innovation education systems and methodologies that make the country a more conducive environment for innovation. This strategy will allow for the creation, attraction and retention of a large community of creative individuals in different fields. Education in innovation infrastructure requires more than putting in the right systems. It also requires a mindset change in science education itself. It is with this mindset that our proposed conference is situated, by proposing a novel methodology to conduct science education that brings together researchers from the Humanities and Empirical Sciences.

## Program and Speakers

Marcos Carvalho - O Dr. Marcos focará a sua apresentação em Narrativa e Educação, contrapondo e fazendo um balanço a partir de autores como Martha Nussbaum, Richard Rorty, Gayatri Spivak, Kwame Anthony Appiah e Idelber Avelar. O seu texto irá então propor uma contextualização tanto na relação com o ensino de ciência quanto em uma abordagem centrada na África, utilizando uma perspectiva situada inspirada no livro [Epistemologias do Sul](http://www.boaventuradesousasantos.pt/media/EspacoAcademico_Abril2011.pdf).

Ricardo Pietrobon - Dr. Pietrobon focuses on the field Empirical Sciences in Education. His workshop will focus on the role of educational randomized trials, why they are important, their relationship with causality, general design principles and how the interaction will proceed for the remaining of the course.

## Conference venue and technical aspects

We will host this conference at the <!-- add location --> at UNILAB, thus not only taking advantage of the local academic community of this young university, but also promoting the city. The venue can be described as follow: <!-- Marcos, por favor acrescente detalhes onde você planeja realizar -->
internet

## Facilities and accomodation for attendees

Access to the conference and the city can be made by car as well as other means of transportation. These include <!-- Marcos, por favor adicione -->

UNILAB is surrounded by hotels and restaurants that can be used by conference participants. Among them are included <!-- Marcos, por favor adicione -->

## Event promotion

In order to conduct the event promotion, we will make use of our existing Web site focused on [Education and Narrative](http://educacaonarrativa.org). This site currently contains information on its national and international participants, including professors and students from differente academic institutions who currently involved in our project. 

In order to disseminate the information about this conference, we will have a conserted effort executed by three of our voluntary students, namely <!-- Marcos, adicionar nomes-->. Their strategy is described as follows:

1. We will start generating content about narrative and education in the form of PDF articles, screen casting videos, and other pieces specifically directed at researchers in the humanities as well as teachers
2. This material will be posted on our site at [http://educacaonarrativa.org/](http://educacaonarrativa.org/), where interested parties can obtain it in exchange for their contact information and the agreement that they might be contacted later on.
3. When a our conference reaches the publicity phase, this contact information will then be used to invite individuals to participate in the conference.

Links to our content will be disseminated through the following venues: LinkedIn, Google Plus, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, specific mailing lists for certain societies or interest groups, university mailing lists, influential bloggers and/or social network "rock stars," academic leagues, academic clubs and centers and appropriate government organizations.

## Post-conference survey

At the end of the conference, we will circulate an online survey among participants to better understand what they liked and did not like. This brief, 3-minute survey will cover three main aspects: (1) What they have learned, (2) how satisfied they were with the choice of topics, (4) how satisfied they were with the overal conference organization, (5) how they think this conference will affect their daily practice, be it in education or research.


## Post-conference dissemination

At the end of the conference we will post all videos into a dedicated www.youtube.com channel at <!-- add link -->, whose link will also be made available at our site at [http://educacaonarrativa.org](http://educacaonarrativa.org). This channel will then be publicized using the same means we have gathered as described under the Event Promotion section.

<!-- add dissemination manual -->

## Post-conference article and other publications

Finally, in order to summarize the content of this conference as well as to interpret it from both a Humanities as well as a Empirical Science perspective, we will publish a peer-reviewed article. Briely, our article will attempt to bring together selected aspects brought up by individual speakers, also connecting to the individual Empirical science designs (publicly published under the [Github]() site.
